  <h2>Short description of work</h2>
  <div>
  <p><em>Being water</em> is an audiovisual, immersive space in which we are invited to see, feel and think in the perspective of water.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Description of work</h2>
  <div>
  <p>You find yourself immersed in water, it’s particles moving around you. You notice 
    the presence of water-beings. You listen to the sounds of the water and to the 
    waterbeings and you find yourself immersed in water, <em>being water</em>. 
    </p>

<p><em>Being Water</em> is a digital space dedicated to see, feel and think in the perspective of 
    water. The collaborative project started with the 360º videos that Andrés Isaza made 
    putting the camera in a fishing cane. These images made by the river on its flux 
    inspired Terhi Martilla to write and record herself to give voice to the river. 
    These same words were used by Rafaela Nunes’ to create the water-beings that arise 
    from her unique artistic process of co-creation with LLMs and diffusion models. 
    Finally Paulo Bala’s specialized the sound in the sphere into an immersive, 
    interactive, audiovisual experience. The water-beings float in the sphere and 
    the user can move within the water to see and listen to the environment from 
    different vantage points. Always creating a new combination of words, songs and images, 
    being water alongside the other water beings.
</p>

<p>The work is presented on a laptop computer with speakers/headphones, 
    and each person can experience the work on their own. Alternatively, 
    the work can be exhibited using a projector and speakers (see technical requirements) 
    to open the experience to the other exhibition visitors as one person interacts with it.
</p>

<p>The work is currently exported as an HTML5 build, yet, our intention is to tweak 
    the code to make it compatible with VR headsets in time for ICIDS2024. 
    The current build is at proof-of-concept stage, and conveys only one “instance” 
    of the waterworlds. The team is working to expand the work to include water-beings 
    that can toggle between four unique waterworlds (ocean, pond, rocky caverns, stream). 
    Each waterworld is made up of a different 360° video, different waterbeings, 
    and different voice and audio. 
</p>

<h2>Technical requirements</h2>
<div>
  <p>I am water is currently an immersive experience that exists as an HTML5 build (unity). 
    The work requires a recent (2020->) laptop computer to run smoothly. The work requires 
    an electricity outlet for the laptop. The work runs offline and does not require an 
    Internet connection. Below, we outline three possible scenarios for technical requirements.
</p>

<p><b>Option solo:</b> The work can either be a solo experience: experienced via the laptop screen 
    and headphones. The team will be able to provide both the laptop and headphones.
</p>

<p><b>Option collective:</b> Alternately, the work can be exhibited as a collective experience, 
    with the view of the work projected onto a screen and sound output through speakers. 
    This could broaden the interactivity environment and include more people simultaneously 
    participating in the work. One user/player will interact with the work on a laptop computer. 
    The team will be able to provide the laptop, but will require assistance with the projector or screen and speakers.
</p>

<p><b>Option “if accepted”:</b> The ultimate goal is to translate <em>Being water</em> for VR headsets. 
    If accepted for the ICIDS 2024 art exhibition, the team will rework the code of 
    the project to make it compliant with VR headsets. This is entirely feasible in 
    the timeframe between the notice of acceptance and the conference. The team will 
    be able to provide the laptop and the VR headset. The video and audio stream can 
    also be sent to projector and speakers (as per option collective), but the team 
    will need assistance with this equipment.
